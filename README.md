Week 6 Challenge Weather Dashboard

This week we had to build from scratch a site that would display the current weather and give a 5 day forecast for a specific city.

This was acccomplished using fetching from the open weather api. When a valid city is entered into the search bar and the search button is clicked, the database is searched for that specific city and the temperature, wind speed, and humidity are returned for the current time and 5 days into the future. 

In addition, the previous searches will be saved via local storage and can be reclicked on to pull up their weather again.
